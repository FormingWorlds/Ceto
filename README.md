Exoplanet_atmosphere_model_vMCMC_SiH4_2024_xB.py is a version of the simulated annealing/MCMC code used to model planetary embryo chemical equilibrium in Young et al. (2023, Nature).
Input file initial_atm_vMCMC_2024.txt includes requisite inputs (note there are two temperatures, one for the atmosphere-melt boundary and one for the core-mantle boundary. 
This update includes silane in the gas phase and treating water as OH in the melt phase.
